This is the Purdue ACM SIGOPS's introduction to git! It was originally forked from SIGART's
repo so that we would have our own seperate sandbox for new members to mess around with git.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll hopefully have a better understanding of how to use git.

To start, open the terminal and run:
    git clone https://github.com/purdue-sig-ops/learningGit.git

After running the above command, you should have a folder named 'learningGit' in the current
working directory.  To continue, open the file named 'BEGIN' and follow along.
